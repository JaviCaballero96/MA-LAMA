# pddl2-SAS-translate

This project aims to build a complete translator from temporal pddl2.1 to SAS+-1 tasks
and is based on the LAMA translate module.

To launch: python3 translate.py domain.pddl problem.pddl
The translator will write its result to a file called "output.sas", which serves as an input to the next phase.
